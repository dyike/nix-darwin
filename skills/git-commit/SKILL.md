# git-commit

Use this when the user asks to commit changes, split work into commits, or write a good commit message from actual repo changes.

## Goal

Atomic, reviewable, semantically clear commits that are safe to revert, cherry-pick, and bisect.
This skill is language-agnostic: decide commit boundaries from the diff and repository conventions, not from the programming language.

## Core workflow

1. **Discover repo conventions**
   Check for repository-specific commit guidance before proposing a message.
   Prefer, in order:
   - `.github/*` files that describe commit style, templates, or issue linking
   - `.gitmessage`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `commitlint` / conventional commit config
   - recent commit history

2. **Inspect**
   Run:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   git diff --stat
   git diff
   ```
   If anything is staged, also run:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached
   ```

3. **Group**
   Split changes by logical purpose.

   Common groups:
   - `feat`
   - `fix`
   - `refactor`
   - `perf`
   - `docs`
   - `test`
   - `build` / `ci` / `chore`

   Usually split when you see:
   - refactor + behavior change
   - formatting + logic change
   - dependency updates + product code
   - unrelated docs + code
   - generated churn without clear source change

4. **Propose and approve**
   Before committing, show:
   - what changed
   - recommended commit boundary or boundaries
   - candidate commit message(s)
   - risks / ambiguities
   - any repo-specific template or format that will be followed

   Get user approval before staging or committing when boundaries are not already explicit.

5. **Stage selectively**
   Prefer:
   ```bash
   git add -p
   ```
   Do not default to bulk staging. Stage only the intended hunks.

6. **Validate deterministically**
   If the repository has configured a native `git` pre-commit hook, it must run during commit creation.
   This is mandatory when configured; do not skip validation unless the user explicitly asks to commit without verification.
   Use the normal `git commit` path so Git invokes the configured hook automatically.
   If validation fails, stop and report the failure without retrying with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly asks.
   If no pre-commit hook is configured, say so explicitly instead of implying the check ran.

7. **Commit**
   Commit only after the above steps are satisfied.

## Commit message rules

Default subject format unless repository conventions say otherwise:
```text
type(scope): summary
```

Examples:
- `fix(router): avoid nil worker panic during reconnect`
- `refactor(runtime): split worker lifecycle management`
- `docs(skill): simplify git commit instructions`

Guidelines:
- Use the most precise type possible.
- Prefer a real scope when obvious; otherwise omit it.
- Keep the summary short and specific.
- Use a body only when the why is non-obvious.
- Avoid vague subjects like `update`, `misc fixes`, `wip`, or `changes`.

## Issue linking

Detect issue ID in this order:

1. **User mention** - if the user explicitly says "fix #123" or "closes #456", use that.
2. **Branch name** - extract from common patterns:
   - `<type>/<short-desc>-<issueID>` such as `fix/http-bug-4`
   - `<type>/<short-desc>-gh-<issueID>` such as `fix/http-bug-gh-4`
   - `fix-123-xxx`, `123-fix-xxx`
   - `issue-123`, `issue/123`
   - `GH-123`, `gh-123`
   - `#123` anywhere in branch name

Choose the link format from repo conventions:

- If the user explicitly asked for auto-close semantics with words like "fix", "close", or "resolve", use `Fixes #123` or the repo's preferred closing keyword.
- If the change only relates to an issue, prefer `Refs #123`.
- If the repo template expects a footer, place the issue reference in the footer.
- If the repo template expects inline linking, prefer: `fix(scope): description (#123)`
- If no template is present, prefer a footer when auto-close semantics are desired

If no issue ID is found, do not invent one. If the user rejects the detected ID, defer to the user.
When the issue ID comes only from the branch name, use `Refs #123` by default unless the commit clearly fixes/closes that issue.

## Guardrails

- Inspect before staging or committing.
- Keep one logical change per commit.
- Keep fix + directly related tests together.
- Split unrelated refactors, formatting, dependency churn, and generated noise.
- Report validation status and whether the native `git` pre-commit hook actually ran.
- Report the final commit hash after a successful commit.
- Do not auto-push, auto-force-push, rewrite history, or use `--no-verify` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, conflict markers, local artifacts, accidental binaries, or unrelated changes.
- Do not claim checks passed when they were not run.

## Default response shape

Before committing, summarize changed/staged/unstaged/untracked files, mixed concerns, risky files, proposed commit message(s), what each commit includes/excludes, and ask for approval when needed.
